# Spectral Clustering - Part 2

This repository contains the implementation of Spectral Clustering for **Homework 2 (Part 2)** of the **MDA2024** course and demonstrates the use of spectral clustering on synthetic and/or real-world datasets, along with performance analysis and visualization.

##  File Overview

- `Spectral_Clustering_Part_2.ipynb`: 
  A Jupyter Notebook implementing spectral clustering, including steps for:
  - Constructing similarity matrices (e.g., Gaussian kernel).
  - Computing the Laplacian matrix.
  - Eigen decomposition.
  - Applying k-means on the embedded representation.
  - Evaluating and visualizing clustering results.

##  Requirements

Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn
